# Enigma
###### Jane Greene's self assessment Enigma project 2003 BE
#### Functionality
Meets expectation
:
Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.
#### Object Oriented Programming
Above expectation
: I have implemented inheritance in a logical manner between the Cipher and Enigma classes. Cipher houses all the random generation and helper methods. Enigma inherits from Cipher and houses the encrypt and decrypt methods for better encapsulation.  
#### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
Meets expectation
: Classes, methods, and variables are well named so that they clearly communicate their purpose. Code is all properly indented and syntax is consistent. I would love to give myself an above for this but I do have one method over 10 lines remaining.
#### Test Driven Development
Meets expectation
: Obvious edge cases are addressed. Git history demonstrates writing tests before implementation code. Test coverage metrics show coverage at 99% or greater. I am using one stub for date.
#### Version Control
Meets expectation
: All pull requests include related and logical chunks of functionality, and are named and documented to clearly communicate the purpose of the pull request. At least 30 commits.
